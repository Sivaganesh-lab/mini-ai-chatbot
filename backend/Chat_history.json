{"question": "What is blockchain?", "answer": "Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger technology that records transactions across many computers in a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. This technology is best known as the foundation for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but its applications extend far beyond that.\n\nKey characteristics of blockchain include:\n\n1. **Decentralization**: Unlike traditional databases that are usually controlled by a single entity, a blockchain is maintained by a network of nodes (computers) that participate in the network, making it more resilient to failures and attacks.\n\n2. **Transparency**: Transactions are recorded in a way that they can be viewed publicly (in public blockchains), allowing participants to verify the information independently.\n\n3. **Immutability**: Once a transaction is added to the", "source": "AI (OpenRouter)"}
{"question": "What is blockchain?", "answer": "Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger technology that securely records transactions across multiple computers in such a way that the recorded transactions cannot be altered retroactively. Here's a breakdown of its main features:\n\n1. **Decentralization**: Unlike traditional databases that are controlled by a single entity, blockchain is maintained by a network of computers (nodes). Each participant in the network has access to the entire ledger.\n\n2. **Transparency**: All transactions are visible to participants in the network. This transparency helps to build trust among users, as they can verify transactions independently.\n\n3. **Immutability**: Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it is extremely difficult to change or delete. This is achieved through cryptographic hashing and consensus protocols that ensure all nodes", "source": "AI (OpenRouter)"}

{"question": "What is blockchain?", "answer": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant record-keeping. At its core, a blockchain consists of a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions or data entries, along with a cryptographic hash of the previous block. This structure makes it difficult to alter any information without consensus from the network, as changing one block would require changes to all subsequent blocks.\n\nKey characteristics of blockchain include:\n\n1. **Decentralization**: Unlike traditional databases controlled by a central authority, a blockchain is maintained by a network of computers (nodes) that work together to validate and record transactions.\n\n2. **Transparency**: All transactions on a public blockchain are visible to all participants, promoting accountability and trust among", "source": "OpenAI"}
